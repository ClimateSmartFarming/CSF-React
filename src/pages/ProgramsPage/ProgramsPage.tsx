                    peer-to-peer learning program that builds climate resilience across farms, forests, and communities.
                    CAMF is a partnership between the USDA Northeast Climate Hub and Cornell University, designed to
                    empower farmers and agricultural advisors to gain and share knowledge and tools needed to be
                    resilient in the face of climate uncertainty.

                    advisors who were concerned about climate impacts on farms, and were motivated to develop climate
                    adaptation and/or mitigation plans for their operations. The program also helped train agriculture
                    service providers to work with dairy farmers on planning and implementing strategies, and
                    strengthened their ability to provide climate-focused support.

                    weather events. Additionally, the team emphasizes the important role farms play in reducing
                    greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration. Key practices include use of cover crops,
                    agroforestry, rotational grazing, water management, manure management, and nitrogen-use
                    efficiency.</p>

                    foundational artificial intelligence (AI) by incorporating knowledge from agriculture and forestry
                    sciences and leveraging these unique, new AI methods to curb weather effects while lifting rural
                    economies. By creating a new scientific discipline and innovation ecosystem intersecting AI and
                    weather-smart agriculture and forestry, our researchers and practitioners will discover and invent
                    compelling AI-powered knowledge and solutions. Examples include AI-enhanced estimation methods of
                    greenhouse gases and specialized field-to-market decision support tools. A key goal is to lower the
                    cost of and improve accounting for carbon in farms and forests to empower carbon markets and inform
                    decision-making. The Institute will also expand and diversify rural and urban AI workforces.
